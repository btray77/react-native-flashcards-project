# Flashcards
Flashcards is an app to help you study. It allows you to create decks of flashcards, add cards (each one has a question and an answer) to the decks and run a quiz to test your own skills. At the end of the quiz, you'll see your score.

This project was developed as a part of the [Udacity's React course](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## How to start the app
After cloning this project, you have to install and run the app:
```
cd react-native-flashcards
yarn install
yarn start
```
You can use the Expo app on your phone or install a simulator on your computer to see this app running.

## Tested
This app was only tested on android devices. Therefore, it's not possible to guarantee it will run on iOS devices too.
